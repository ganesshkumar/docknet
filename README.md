`JUST STARTED`

An Open Source Docker UI project. There are few other UI projects which can operate on images and containers. The aim of this project is to go beyond that and provide all the functionalities provided by docker.

I started this project mainly because I have 15-20 images in my system and run 5-10 containers with 5-6 paramerters. So to run the containers everytime, I have to rely on my terminal history to be time efficient. I want to move them to a UI dashboard so lot more poeple can use docker at scale on their localmachine.
